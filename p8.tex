\noindent{}At the entrance of the modern time stands the ``God-man.'' At its 
exit will only the God in the God-man evaporate? And can the God-man really 
die if only the God in him dies? They did not think of this question, and 
thought they were through when in our days they brought to a victorious end 
the work of the Illumination, the vanquishing of God: they did not notice that 
Man has killed God in order to become now -- ``sole God on high.'' The 
\textit{other world outside us} is indeed brushed away, and the great 
undertaking of the Illuminators completed; but the \textit{other world in 
us}has become a new heaven and calls us forth to renewed heaven-storming: God 
has had to give place, yet not to us, but to -- Man. How can you believe that 
the God-man is dead before the Man in him, besides the God, is dead?
